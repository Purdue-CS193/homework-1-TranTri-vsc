# TRI TRAN's First CS193 Homework

CS193 has only started 3 weeks back and I have yet to much of a conclusive opinion on the course. Here is what has been on my mind so far:

- The instructors are doing what they are supposed to do.
- The vacant first PSO class gave me and other students lots of time to contemplate on our choices in life (the notice should have been out sooner).
- Not a lot of work for 1 credit and you get to learn tools and techniques that would come into use in the future (being introduced to GitHub on the second week is an awesome opportunity for me).
